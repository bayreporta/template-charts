	<div class="hed"><h1>Funding for Local Control Funding Formula</h1><p>In 2013, the Legislature passed the Local Control Funding Formula, a new system for education financing that provides uniform base funding per student while channeling extra dollars to districts based on enrollment of English learners, low-income children and foster youths. The Legislature projected it would take eight years to phase in the new formula. 2013-14 was the first year under the formula. Although robust revenues put the funding ahead of schedule in FY 2015-16, the Department of Finance is sticking with its projection of full funding &mdash; the completion of the transition period &mdash; in FY 2020-21.</p> </div>
